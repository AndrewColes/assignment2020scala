//(1) Complete the clean function below. It should find
//    all words in a string using the regular expression
//    \w+  and the library function 
//
//         some_regex.findAllIn(some_string)
//
//    The words should be Returned as a list of strings.


def clean(s: String) : List[String] = ???
  


//(2) The function occurrences calculates the number of times  
//    strings occur in a list of strings. These occurrences should 
//    be calculated as a Map from strings to integers.


def occurrences(xs: List[String]): Map[String, Int] = ???


//(3) This functions calculates the dot-product of two documents
//    (list of strings). For this it calculates the occurrence
//    maps from (2) and then multiplies the corresponding occurrences. 
//    If a string does not occur in a document, the product is zero.
//    The function finally sums up all products. 


def prod(lst1: List[String], lst2: List[String]) : Int = ???


//(4) Complete the functions overlap and similarity. The overlap of
//    two documents is calculated by the formula given in the assignment
//    description. The similarity of two strings is given by the overlap
//    of the cleaned strings (see (1)).

usually broken into short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic)
